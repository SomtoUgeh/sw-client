# Star Wars Client

This is a simple React app for ingesting the
[Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

## Build setup

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# start server
yarn start

# check tests ✅
yarn test
```

## Overview

As this is a simple consume website for the Star Wars API - there are a few
things a user is probably going to want to do.

1. View all root types, and the resources inside them
2. Click though and see a detailed breakdown of the information on each resource
   type
3. Easily access other linked resources
4. Favorite a resource type - this must persist after page refresh however it
   doesn't need to be stored on a server

## Requirements

- The UI has to be responsive
- There must be test coverage using Jest
- Loading states while the data is being fetched
- As important as the feature set is, keeping coding standards and code
  consistency is key
- Use redux sagas
- Add type support by migrating to TypeScript

## Design

- A good understanding of basic UX principles, and showing that user flow and
  key actions have been thought through throughly.
- This is Star Wars isn't it? Have some fun! 🚀 👽

## Brownie points

- Inline resource filtering 🕵🏻‍♀️
- Animations on the loading states ⚛️
- Very clean and modular styled components 🛀

Have fun, we look forward to seeing what you've come up with.
